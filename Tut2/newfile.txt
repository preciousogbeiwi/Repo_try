Create a git repo and remote starting locally

Create a new repo locally
Create any change, for example, create a file named hello_world.txt
Make a commit
Make a new change in the same file
Add it to staging
Oh no that was actually a mistake! I didn't mean to stage it
Use git reset to reset the staging area
Make a new branch called Cozy_Branch
Make a file called test.txt and put something on the first line
Switch back to master or main, depending on the name git used to initialised your repo (don't merge the changes)
Make a new branch called Sweet_Branch
Make ANOTHER file called test.txt (we're trying to cause a merge conflict)
Commit the change to this branch
Now merge Cozy_Branch into Sweet_Branch (which branch does that mean you need to run the command from?).
You should get a merge conflict in that file where incompatible changes have been made
Fix the conflict by editing the file
Commit the fix
Merge the changes into master or main
